# 🤖 Automated Service Request & Warranty Triage Engine

## 🔍 Overview  
An intelligent, rule-based automation engine to streamline, validate, and triage high-volume technical service requests — instantly.  
This engine checks warranty info, validates part IDs, and routes complex cases with zero manual delays.

## ⚠️ The Challenge  

In a high-volume support ecosystem, every incoming service request demands thorough validation:

- ⌛ Manual reviews are slow and error-prone  
- 🔄 Repetitive checks waste support agents’ time  
- ❌ Delays frustrate users and impact SLAs  

---

## ✅ The Solution  

Introducing the **Automated Service Request & Warranty Triage Engine** – an end-to-end automation pipeline that:

- ✅ Validates requests in real-time  
- ✅ Checks warranty status via live CRM queries  
- ✅ Detects anomalies and flags exceptions for Level 2 (L2) review  
- ✅ Delivers instant resolution for valid, straightforward issues  

All within **seconds**.

## 🚀 How It Works: The Automation Flow  

Every incoming request passes through a multi-stage validation pipeline:

### 🔹 1. Data Ingestion  
Reads & parses service requests from the main Service Portal (JSON/XML format).  
**Extracted fields include:**  
- Serial No.  
- Diagnostic Code  
- Part ID  
- Customer ID  

---

### 🔹 2. Initial Triage & Rule-Based Filtering  

Applies a set of critical business rules to detect red flags:

| Rule                 | Description                        |
|----------------------|------------------------------------|
| ✅ Product Eligibility | Confirms product line is supported |
| ❌ Part Quantity Check| Detects suspicious part quantities |
| ⚠️ Diagnostic Code Check | Flags invalid or unknown error codes |
| 🚫 Warranty Mismatch | Detects out-of-warranty hardware   |
| ❓ Identity Verification | Flags mismatched customer/product IDs |

📤 **Any failed rule → Auto-routed to L2 Manual Review**

---

### 🔹 3. Automated Validation Pipeline  

If the request passes the triage, it enters advanced validation:

- 🧩 **Part ID Validation** – Ensures the part exists & is approved  
- 🧪 **Diagnostic Session Scan** – Validates session ID logs  
- 🔍 **Keyword Analysis** – Parses technical notes for known issues  
- 📦 **Part List & Quantity Match** – Confirms BOM (Bill of Materials) accuracy  

---

### 🔹 4. Specialized Warranty Check – Batteries  

For battery components, an additional layer of validation is triggered:

- 🗃️ Real-time CRM/Warranty DB query  
- ✅ Verifies exact coverage window  
- 🕒 Cross-checks purchase date, claim window, and SKU match  

---

### 🔹 5. Final Decision  

| Condition         | Action                           |
|------------------|----------------------------------|
| ✅ All checks passed | Auto-approved for fulfillment   |
| ❌ Any failure        | 🚩 Escalated to L2 for manual triage |
